# TheBridge_DataScience_Proyecto_Synthetic_data_bank_generator

## Project description:

This project is a synthetic data bank generator that allows you to generate synthetic data sets with different characteristics and different distributions. 
The project includes a notebook that explains the different methods and distributions that can be used to generate synthetic data sets.
